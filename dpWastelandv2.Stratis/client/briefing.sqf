<br/>
Hardcore Mode:<br/>
- The dp Wasteland mod allows the admin to disable player tags and/or disable groups to give a harder more tactical game play (This has had good feedback apart for the odd troll).<br/>
- This is not difficult to understand or get use too, so please give it a go and dont whine.<br/>
- Tags are disabled for everyone, blufor, opfor and independents. Use your scanner to identify players (sometimes the coloured cap are a decoy).<br/>
- Think before shooting, even with tags off excessive team killing can result in a kick from the server.<br/>
- Try stay in cover and even talk over direct chat and engage with the other player.<br/>
- Remember independents and independants so dont complain if everyone kills you, if groups are disabled they are disabled for everyone.<br/>

General Game Play:<br/>
- Each player starts with the following in their player menu: 1 food, 1 water, 1 single use medkit, 1 single use repair kit and 1 empty jerry can<br/>
- Jerry cans can be filled at the fuel station, the general stores, green oil barrels found around the island or by syphoning fuel from vehicles<br/>
- Loot dead bodies for money and players gear, items are no longer dropped<br/>
- To give someone an item you must stand close to them and use the player menu to give the selected item to the select player<br/>
- The general store sells, uniform items, food, water, single use medkits and repair kits and fuel<br/>
- There are usually 58 ground vehicles, 8 helis, 12 ammo/weapons crates, 12 survival items (food sacks, water containers) in the game at any one time<br/>
- Vehicles with mounted guns, wheeled apc's, tracked armour, armed heli's and extra ammo/weapons crates can be obtained by completing the regular in-game objectives<br/>
- Only the lower powered guns can be found in vehicles. Higher powered guns and launchers can be found in ammo/weapons crates or bought at gunstores<br/>
- Gunstores sell a full range of weaponry and ammo<br/>
- To build a base buy items from the construction store make sure to leave space for the objects to spawn in, vehicles and sandbags dont mix well<br/>
- The Scanner will detect the enemy and display their coloured tag above their head. This is only a 2% chance for a second. The scanner will also display team mates tags if the admin has disabled them for a hardcore game.<br/>
